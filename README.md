There are bunch of gradle tasks that you can see by doing _gradle tasks
* _build is to build the app.
* _setupdb_ is to recreate the database and schema.
* _seed_ is to seed in the reference data.
* _testseed_ puts in some test data which can be used to browse through basic functionality in the system.
